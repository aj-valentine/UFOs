# UFO Sightings Analysis 
Analysis Using JavaScript and HTML 

## Overview of the UFO Sightings Analysis :alien:

This project was created for Dana, a data journalist, who had to write an article about UFO sightings across the United States. The purpose of this analysis is to use JavaScript to create an html file that will read the UFO sightings information into a table. Once it is in the table, we created filters that allow the user to filter the information by: date, city, state, country, and by shape of the UFO (i.e. a light beam.) Along with the filters, formatting and imagery has been added to the html file to spruce it up for Dana's readers. 

## UFO Sightings Results

In order to use the filtered table, I have included step by step instructions below with screenshots so Dana can explain to her readers how to view the information. 

### 1. Overview of the HTML file page: 
- Contains various filter boxes on the left side, and the data table on the right.

### 2. How to filter for information: 
- Type in desired filter information. For example, in the image below, I have filtered: 
date: 1/1/2010
city: fresno
state: ca
country: us
shape: light

## Summary

To summarize, an HTML page has been created using JavaScript code. We used a js file filled with UFO sightings information, and wrote code to create various filters to filter the information. Then, we formatted the information using HTML and CSS. One drawback of this design is that it displays all of the UFO sightings on the page, making it look a bit cluttered and overwhelming. In order to improve this, we could include a button/filter that displays all sightings when clicked. Another improvement could include hiding the comments and adding an expand button - this would reduce the clutter as well and allow the viewer to focus on the data.
